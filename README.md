1. Dice Rolling Game Project
Input: A student provides a static number between 1 and 6.
Roll the Dice: The program randomly generates a value between 1 and 6.
Winning Situation: A winning situation occurs when the given static/fixed number is exactly the same as the number rolled by the dice.
Play Multiple Times: The user can play the game as many times as they want until they choose to exit.
Scoring: Whenever a winning situation occurs, points are awarded to the user. The scores accumulate if the user plays the game multiple times.
2. Number Guessing Game
Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number. You can incorporate additional details as follows:
Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won
